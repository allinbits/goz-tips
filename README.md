# remove your old relayer config folder

## debugging relayer issues
```
# relayer errors when trying to send
# you need to make sure when you run `rly tx link $AIB_GOZ`
# you get a checkmark next to channel created, e.g.
Channel created: [aib-goz-1]chan{oigbfuzeen}port{transfer}

# if you created a path 90 minutes ago, you  may need to
# create a new path due to the default path timeout

# client: packet commitment verification failed
# if you get this error you may have unsent tx in the queue
# view unrelayed txs with:
rly q unrelayed $AIB_GOZ

# you may see some unrelayed txs
â”‚{"src":["1","2"]}

# you can relay unsent txs with
rly tx rly $AIB_GOZ

#----------
# err(sdk: out of gas) 
# if you get this error you may have to increase the gas amount
rly ch edit $C_GOZ gas {{ higher_amount }}

# then relay unsent again with 
rly tx rly $AIB_GOZ

#----------
# err(sdk: insufficient funds)
# if you get this error you need to add more tokens to your account
# or alternatively increase the gas amount
# see how much gas a transaction would cost by appending -d 

# for example to see how much sending all unrelayed txs would cost is 
rly tx rly $AIB_GOZ -d
```

# how to query your balance on another blockchain

# send tokens via local RPC
gaiacli tx send $ADDR_AIB $YOUR_AIB_ADDR 1000bits

# how to send tokens via remote RPC
gaiacli tx send $ADDR_GOZ $YOUR_GOZ_ADDR 100000doubloons --node=$RPC_GOZ --chain-id=gameofzoneshub-1a
